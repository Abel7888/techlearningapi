Breakthroughs like AlphaFold3 and RFdiffusion allow scientists to design entirely new proteins, while GPT-like models (e.g., TamGen) and diffusion/variational autoencoder approaches generate potent, diverse drug candidates with high hit rates. Industry adoption is accelerating, with major pharma (Novartis, Roche, Sanofi) forming billion-dollar partnerships with AI-first companies like Insilico Medicine, Generate Biomedicines, and Recursion. The U.S. market is growing at 30–38% CAGR through 2030, driven by funding, collaboration, and closed-loop design-test workflows. FDA’s emerging AI guidance emphasizes transparency and validation, signaling growing regulatory acceptance. Together, these advances mark a shift toward faster, cheaper, and more innovative drug pipelines that expand chemical space and improve the odds of finding first-in-class therapies.",

It begins with short-answer questions that explain how different AI models are applied in drug discovery, such as diffusion models for generating small molecules (with the example of TamGen), VAE combined with active learning for designing kinase inhibitors, and a comparison of GANs and Transformers in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The second part presents a real-world case study on Rentosertib, an AI-discovered TNIK inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting how AI pipelines can both discover new targets and generate first-in-class molecules while significantly reducing R&D timelines. The final part encourages reflection, asking learners to evaluate which AI model type they would prioritize for cancer drug discovery and justify their reasoning. Altogether, the exercise blends conceptual understanding, applied case analysis, and critical evaluation, ensuring learners grasp not only the technical aspects but also the real-world impact of AI in accelerating compound screening.",
