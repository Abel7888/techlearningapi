                                           "description":  "The learning exercise on AI-driven compound screening is designed in three parts to build both knowledge and critical thinking. It begins with short-answer questions that explain how different AI models are applied in drug discovery, such as diffusion models for generating small molecules (with the example of TamGen), VAE combined with active learning for designing kinase inhibitors, and a comparison of GANs and Transformers in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The second part presents a real-world case study on Rentosertib, an AI-discovered TNIK inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting how AI pipelines can both discover new targets and generate first-in-class molecules while significantly reducing R\u0026D timelines. The final part encourages reflection, asking learners to evaluate which AI model type they would prioritize for cancer drug discovery and justify their reasoning. Altogether, the exercise blends conceptual understanding, applied case analysis, and critical evaluation, ensuring learners grasp not only the technical aspects but also the real-world impact of AI in accelerating compound screening.",

Students learn to use detailed financial templates and real-world case studies (like 45 Broadway\u0027s 15.8% energy reduction saving $42K annually) to justify investments typically ranging $10-25 per square foot with 2-4 year paybacks. The course covers four progressive scenarios from mid-size office retrofits to large mixed-use developments, teaching risk analysis, vendor selection, and implementation strategies for the rapidly growing $571B smart building market. Practical exercises include sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and digital twin ROI calculations, culminating in a capstone project managing a $15M portfolio transformation. Advanced modules address emerging technologies (AI, edge computing), ESG integration, and regulatory compliance to position professionals as smart building leaders. Graduates gain the technical and financial expertise to deliver measurable energy savings, operational efficiency, and property value enhancements while achieving sustainability goals.\n\n",
